# Scripts

This is a small collection of scripts that I wanted to sync across my machines. Feel free to use these and alias them to commands in your `.zshrc` or whatever you call your shell configuration file.

## ts-node-init.sh

This script initializes a barebones Node project with TypeScript in the current working directory.

### Usage

`./ts-node-init.sh my-new-app`
